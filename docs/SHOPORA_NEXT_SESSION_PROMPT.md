You are working in my local ShopOra repo.

Project:
- ShopOra
- Repo: dmcgee2121/shopora
- Local path: C:\Users\flygr\OneDrive\Desktop\ShopOra
- Stack: React 18 + Vite + React Router + Supabase + Stripe Checkout via Netlify Functions

Current branch:
- v0.66-production-qa-polish

Current state:
- v0.64 deployed successfully and the production smoke test passed
- v0.65 captured the post-deploy stability checkpoint
- v0.66 is a small production QA polish pass focused on copy, layout, and accessibility cleanup only
- No major feature work started after deploy
- Workflow is local-first
- Do not push, merge, deploy, open a PR, or trigger Netlify unless explicitly requested

Important no-touch areas:
- all `src` app behavior
- checkout submission
- order creation
- Stripe functions
- Netlify functions/env
- Supabase RLS
- auth behavior
- env files/secrets
- package/dependency changes

Tasks for the next chat:
1. Reconfirm the current branch and working tree.
2. Reconfirm the branch scope as a small production QA polish pass after the successful v0.64 release.
3. Re-run or inspect:
   - `npm run build`
   - `git status`
   - `git log --oneline -10`
   - `git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat`
   - `git diff origin/main...HEAD --name-only`
   - `git diff origin/main...HEAD -- src`
4. Review these docs:
   - `docs/SHOPORA_V0_66_PRODUCTION_QA_POLISH.md`
   - `docs/SHOPORA_HANDOFF.md`
   - `docs/SHOPORA_V0_65_POST_DEPLOY_SMOKE_AND_STABILITY.md`
5. If continuing the polish review, keep the no-touch areas untouched and do not modify `src`.

Current docs created or updated:
- `docs/SHOPORA_V0_66_PRODUCTION_QA_POLISH.md`
- `docs/SHOPORA_V0_65_POST_DEPLOY_SMOKE_AND_STABILITY.md`
- `docs/SHOPORA_HANDOFF.md`
- `docs/SHOPORA_NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`

Recommended next action:
- Use v0.66 as a lightweight production QA checkpoint or start the next safe feature branch after verification.
